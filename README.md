- Final Year Project Application

## Setup
1. git clone url-at-github
2. npm install
    - to install all the dependencies 
    - make sure you are inside the directory before doing this command
3. npm start

## Take Note
- this is a boilerplate that runs electron and create-react-app together
- this setup has hot-reload meaning any changes made to the app, it will re-compiled and run the application automatically so don't have the exit the app and run again
